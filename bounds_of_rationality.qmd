### Recap 

-   There is a divergence between the predictions of standard economics models and observed human behaviour

-   The assumption of rationality has its limits; bounded willpower, self-interest, rationality

-   Expected Utility Theory

-   Framing effects

</div>

<div>

### Today's Agenda

-   Explore bounded rationality and its implications

-   Understand some important cognitive biases

</div>

---

<div>

-   Maslow's hierarchy of needs

### Bounded Rationality 

-   "Since we have only so much brainpower, and only so much time, we cannot be expected to solve difficult problems optimally. It is eminently “rational” for people to adopt rules of thumb as a way to economize on cognitive faculties. Yet the standard model ignores these bounds and hence the heuristics commonly used. "[^1]

-   Example: Carbon offsets

-   Caution: Although useful, rules of thumb/heuristics can lead to systematic biases and problems.

### Heuristics and Bias

-   There are numerous examples of these heuristics and cognitive biases. We are going to focus in this lecture on the following types of bias:

    1.  Anchoring

    2.  Availability

    3.  Representativeness

    4.  Overconfidence

    5.  Herding

    6.  Commitment

    7.  Gambler's Fallacy

    8.  Authority Bias

### Anchoring Bias

### Example: Judgements of Life Satisfaction[^3] 

-   Freshmen and sophomores at the University of Illinois were asked two questions

    1.  How happy are you in your life in general?

    2.  How happy are you with your dating?

-   When asked in this order, the correlations between the two questions was 0.16. But when the order was reversed, the correlation jumped up to 0.55.

### Gambler's Fallacy/Monte Carlo fallacy

-   It is the belief that, if an event (whose occurrences are independent and identically distributed) has occurred less frequently than expected, it is more likely to happen again in the future (or vice versa).
