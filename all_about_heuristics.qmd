### Recap 

-   People don't have unlimited cognitive abilities and limited attention to make decisions (bounded rationality)

-   To make the decision making process simpler, people rely on heuristics/mental shortcuts

-   Although convenient, these shortcuts can be the source of many major errors and biases

</div>

---

<div>

### Today's Agenda 

-   Delve deeper into these heuristics

-   Understand two important behavioural economics theories:

    1.  Prospect Theory

    2.  Nudge Theory

</div>

<div>

### Prospect Theory 

</div>

---

<div>

### A Slight Detour 

-   Answer the questions given to you with the first answer that comes to your mind. You have 1 minute to answer all the questions.

</div>

---

<div>

### Nudge Theory 

-   Highly recommended reading: Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman

-   We want to start thinking about how to solve these puzzles of human thought and make sense of these seeming contradictions

-   The workings of the brain consists of two components or systems

    -   System 1 is the fast and intuitive

    -   System 2 is the slow and reflective

### Automatic System (System 1)

-   "Action without thought". This system is responsible for rapid and instinctive decisions

-   Examples: reaction when a ball is thrown at you unexpectedly

-   Fun fact: This system is associated with the oldest parts of the brain which we share with lizards and puppies[^1]

<div>

### Reflective System (System 2)

-   This is the more deliberate and self-conscious system.

-   Example: whats 239 \* 196

-   The Automatic System can be thought of as your gut feeling while the reflective system is your conscious thought.

</div>

---

<div>

### More examples of both systems 

1.  When told the temperature in Celsius, most people have an Automatic System reaction while interpreting temperature in Fahrenheit requires use of the Reflective System

2.  People speak their native languages using their Automatic Systems and tend to struggle to speak another language using their Reflective Systems.

### Back to the Detour (Cognitive Reflection Test)[^2]

1.   A bat and ball cost \$1.10 in total. The bat costs \$1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?

2.  If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?

3.   Mary’s mother had four children. The youngest three are named: Spring, Summer, and Autumn. What is the eldest child’s name? \

-   The most common answers to these questions is 10 cents, 100 minutes and Winter. While the correct answers are 5 cents, 5 minutes and Mary respectively.

-   Students from a lot of top universities were asked some of these questions (MIT, Harvard, Princeton) and the wrong answers tended to be popular.[^3]

### What is the Nudge in Nudge Theory 

-   So far we have seen that because people can't think deeply about each choice they face so they tend to accept questions as they are framed instead of trying to consider answers under alternative formulations.

-   What this suggests to us is that people are "nudge-able". Their choices, even in life’s most important decisions, are influenced in ways that would not be anticipated in a standard economic framework.

-   Nudge: "a way to manipulate people’s choices to lead them to make specific decisions... An essential aspect of nudges is that they are not coercive"[^4]

### Examples of Nudges  {.nonincremental}

-   Nudges through provision of information

    -   Calorie counts on menus

    -   Packaging of food products

-   Changes to environment

    -   Having fewer lifts in buildings

    -   Changing default options on phones

-   Financial (dis)incentives to take particular courses of actions

    -   Higher taxes on cigarettes and subsidies for electric vehicles

    -   Positive gamification and mobile apps: Qapital, fitness apps[^5]

### Social Nudges 

-   Social influence is one of the most effective ways to nudge

-   Social influence comes through two categories:

    -   Information

    -   Peer pressure

-   Some examples of the power of social nudges are:

    -   The academic effort of college students is influenced by their peers

    -   Charity donations/Confirm shaming

    -   American judicial system

### Conclusion 

-   People can be nudged to make certain choices and decisions

-   Nudges are inherently non-coercive

-   Nudges make us act reflexively instead of reflectively

-   People's desire to conform make social nudges very powerful
